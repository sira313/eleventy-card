Eleventy Card is a starter project for photographer/artist showing their work and blog randomly. I use `*.html` for default layout cause i don't understand nunjucks or any other. Everything i wrote to build this template is just copy paste, so...
>I apologize for any shortcomings as I am not a coder by background.

### Basic Info
Clone this repo
```
git clone https://github.com/sira313/eleventy-card-bulma/
```
Use PNPM
```
npm install -g pnpm
```
Install modules
```
pnpm install
```
Run to your localhost 
```
pnpm start
```

#### Menu
There are 2 menus (for indexing post, not a single page) we created by default:
- Photos
- Blog

So if you wanted to create another one, maybe [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzf9A9tkkl4) will help.
#### Layout
There are 3 layouts in [/_includes](/_includes/):
- [/_includes/layout.html](/_includes/layout.html) is the main layout called in other layout frontmatter.
- [/_includes/post-blog.html](/_includes/post-blog.html) is for [blog post layout](/blog/posts/).
- [/_includes/post-photos.html](/_includes/post-photos.html) is for [photos post layout](/photos/).
#### Index
There are 3 indexs in this project
- [/index.md](/index.md) where you describe your own business.
- [/photos/index.html](/photos/index.html) is the index of all your photos.
- [/blog/index.html](/blog/index.html) is the index of your blog.
#### Post
Use strip instead of space for post name file. Exc: `your-title-post.md`
##### Photos
Post a work using markdown in [/photos](/photos/) directory.
##### Blog
Write your blog using markdown in [/blog](/blog) directory.
#### Asset
All assets are in [/asset](/asset/) directory and called in the frontmatter.
#### Tips
Better use [Squoosh](https://squoosh.app/) to convert your pics to webp
