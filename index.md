#### Hello World
I used Eleventy to create this website because I find it the easiest Static Site Generator (SSG) to understand, especially with its support for using `*.html` for layout. I chose Daisy framework because its simple tutorials matched my level as a beginner.  As for the icons, I opted for Feathericons simply because I like that it's open source.
The source code of this starter is available on GitHub, just check the navbar.
>I apologize for any shortcomings as I am not a coder by background.
