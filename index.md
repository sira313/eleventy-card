### Hello World
I created this website with Eleventy which i think it's the easier SSG for me to understand because i can use `*.html` for the layout. I choose Bulma as the CSS because it's sample or tutorial just match for me as a noob. And feathericons, i just like it as it's opensource.
The source code of this starter is available on GitHub, just check the navbar.
>I apologize for any shortcomings as I am not a coder by background.
